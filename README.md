# Ammo Mod
A mod for ULTRAKILL that adds an ammo system. 
Whenever you fire any of your guns, you lose ammo. 
You cannot fire a gun unless you have ammo for it. 
You can regain ammo by:
- **Killing enemies.** You get more ammo depending on the enemy type and your current style rank.
- **Parrying.** Parries will restore your ammo to full.
Additionally, in the Cyber Grind after completing a wave your ammo will be replenished to at least half of the maximum value.
